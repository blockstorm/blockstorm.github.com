<ul>
  <li>Griefer: Players who griefed but aren't banned.</li>
  <li>Guest: Players who haven't been promoted to Member yet, they can't build or use commands, usually new players.</li>
  <li>Members: Members of the server can build and use commands.</li>
  <li>VIP: Donors, they have access to some additional commands and creative gamemode.</li>
  <li>Trusted: Players who frequently played on the server for a while without breaking the rules.</li>
  <li>Moderator: Moderators can /kick, /ban, use logblock, etc.</li>
  <li>Admin: Access to all commands.</li>
</ul><h3>How do I become Member?</h3><p>In order to become member you should read the <a href="http://blockstorm.com/rules.html">rules</a> (type /rules in-game) and ask a member of the staff for a promotion.</p><h3>How do I become VIP?</h3><p><a href="http://blockstorm.com/donate.html">Donate</a></p><h3>How do I become Trusted, Moderator or Admin?</h3><p>You don't need to ask for any of these ranks, if the server is looking for staff an admin will contact you.</p><h3>Why am I banned?</h3><p>Most likely you broke the <a href="http://blockstorm.com/rules">rules</a>. If you believe that this is an error contact admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com.</p><h3>What happens after a minecraft update was released?</h3><p>Since it usually takes <a href="http://bukkit.org/">Bukkit</a> a few days to be updated (and for all its plugins to work properly) players can meanwhile play on a temporary map. We use a temporary map to prevent the actual worlds from being griefed without having to shut down the entire server.</p><h3>Any further questions?</h3><p>Send a mail to admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com or log in and talk to the staff.</p></div></div></body></html>
