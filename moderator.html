If the staff decides the server could use more moderators there will be a way to apply or the staff will chose someone. </p><p>Below you can find good reasons for the staff to chose you and arguments we don't think are good reasons.</p><p>Good reasons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You are an <strong>active</strong> player (you are online nearly every day for more than just a few minutes)</li>
  <li>You have been <strong>playing on the server for a while</strong> (a few months are enough, this isn't very important)</li>
  <li>You have <strong>experience</strong> with Minecraft and this server in particular (its commands, rules, etc.)</li>
  <li>You seem like a <strong>mature, nice, helpful</strong> person who would be a good moderator</li>
</ul><p>These aren't reasons: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You have played on the server for <em>X</em> amount of time<br/> While it's nice that you might be one of your oldest players this does not mean you will be a good moderator.</li>
  <li>The only reason you can't be online very much is...<br/> It doesn't really matter why you're inactive, a moderator should be online frequently.</li>
  <li>There aren't enough moderators<br/> Suggest that we could use more moderators, the staff will then decide on that and maybe chose someone.</li>
  <li>You really want to become moderator<br/> A lot of players probably do but we cannot promote everyone. Maybe try starting your own server where you can be owner.</li>
  <li>You deserve it because...<br/> Again, a lot of players do. But we will only promote someone when we need more staff and we will choose the person we think will do the best job.</li>
