You won't get it by playing on the server for a certain amount of time or otherwise 'earning' it. You definitely won't get it by constantly asking the staff about it.</p><p>Instead it's a rank given to players when the staff decides that there aren't enough (active) Moderators to moderate the server. If that's the case there will be a way to apply or the staff will choose someone.</p><p>The following points will make the staff more likely to choose you: </p>
<ul>
  <li>You are an <strong>active</strong> player (you are online frequently for more than just a few minutes)</li>
  <li>You have been <strong>playing on the server for a while</strong> (a few weeks are enough)</li>
  <li>You have <strong>experience</strong> with Minecraft and this server in particular (its rules, commands, worlds etc.)</li>
  <li>You seem like a <strong>mature, friendly, helpful</strong> person who would be a good moderator</li>
</ul></div></div></body></html>
