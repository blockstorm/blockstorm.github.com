###What ranks are there?
- Griefer: Players who griefed but aren't banned.
- Guest: Players who haven't been promoted to Member yet, they can't build or use commands, usually new players.
- Members: Members of the server can build and use commands.
- VIP: Donors, they have access to some additional commands and creative gamemode.
- Trusted: Players who frequently played on the server for a while without breaking the rules.
- Moderator: Moderators can /kick, /ban, use logblock, etc.
- Admin: Access to all commands.

###How do I become Member?
In order to become member you should read the [rules] (http://blockstorm.com/rules.html) (type /rules in-game) and ask a member of the staff for a promotion.

###How do I become VIP?
[Donate] (http://blockstorm.com/donate.html)

###How do I become Trusted, Moderator or Admin?
You don't need to ask for any of these ranks, if the server is looking for staff an admin will contact you.

###Why am I banned?
Most likely you broke the [rules] (http://blockstorm.com/rules). If you believe that this is an error contact admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com.

###What happens after a minecraft update was released?
Since it usually takes [Bukkit] (http://bukkit.org/) a few days to be updated (and for all its plugins to work properly) players can meanwhile play on a temporary map. We use a temporary map to prevent the actual worlds from being griefed without having to shut down the entire server.

###Any further questions?
Send a mail to admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com or log in and talk to the staff.
