1.8 Update (28 August 2014)
---------------------------

As you probably have heard Mojang is about to release the `1.8` update. It will include some [additions and changes] (http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.8#World_Generation) to the world generation code. To make it easier to find these new features we will add new world for `1.8`.

The current main survival world (survival03) as well as its nether and end worlds (survival03_nether and survival03_the_end) will continue to exist.

The old survival world (survival02) stays at least until a world for `1.8` is added but will be removed next. We will let you know at least one month in advance so you can take your items to one of the newer worlds.


Moderator rank (10 February 2014)
---------------------------------

The Moderator rank has been renamed to Admin. The reason is that Moderators and Admins had almost the same permissions anyway. The Trusted rank is now called Moderator. All previously trusted players have been demoted. We will start accepting Moderator applications soon.
