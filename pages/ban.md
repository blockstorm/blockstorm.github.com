#Ban Appeal

A ban can be appealed by sending an e-mail to admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com including the following information:

1. Your minecraft username (make sure to spell it correctly)
2. What you were banned for (lying will not get you unbanned, we can probably check what you did)
3. Why your ban should be lifted
