#Ban Appeal

In order to appeal your ban send an e-mail to admin[at]blockstorm[dot]com.
Include following information:

1. Your minecraft username (make sure to spell it correctly)
2. What you were banned for (lying will not get you unbanned, we probably know exactly what you did)
3. Why your ban should be lifted

Following reasons are not accepted:

- "I didn't know that what I did was against the rules" - You were told to read them when you first joined the server.
- "I told someone my password and they used my account" - It's still *your* account and therefore *your* responsibility.
