How to become Moderator
=======================

Because people keep asking here is some information on how Moderators are chosen.

The Moderator rank is not some kind of reward. You won't get it by playing on the server for a certain amount of time or otherwise 'earning' it. You definitely won't get it by constantly asking the staff about it.

Instead it's a rank given to players when the staff decides that there aren't enough (active) Moderators to moderate the server. If that's the case there will be a way to apply or the staff will choose someone.

The following points will make the staff more likely to choose you:  

- You are an **active** player (you are online frequently for more than just a few minutes)    
- You have been **playing on the server for a while** (a few weeks are enough)   
- You have **experience** with Minecraft and this server in particular (its rules, commands, worlds etc.)  
- You seem like a **mature, friendly, helpful** person who would be a good moderator
