How to become Moderator
=======================

First of all: **Do not ask for higher ranks**. If the staff decides the server could use more moderators there will be a way to apply or the staff will chose someone.  

Below you can find good reasons for the staff to chose you and arguments we don't think are good reasons.

Good reasons:  

- You are an **active** player (you are online nearly every day for more than just a few minutes)    
- You have been **playing on the server for a while** (a few months are enough, this isn't very important)   
- You have **experience** with Minecraft and this server in particular (its commands, rules, etc.)  
- You seem like a **mature, nice, helpful** person who would be a good moderator  

These aren't reasons:  

- You have played on the server for *X* amount of time  
  While it's nice that you might be one of your oldest players this does not mean you will be a good moderator.  
- The only reason you can't be online very much is...   
  It doesn't really matter why you're inactive, a moderator should be online frequently.  
- There aren't enough moderators  
  Suggest that we could use more moderators, the staff will then decide on that and maybe chose someone.  
- You really want to become moderator  
  A lot of players probably do but we cannot promote everyone. Maybe try starting your own server where you can be owner.  
- You deserve it because...  
  Again, a lot of players do. But we will only promote someone when we need more staff and we will choose the person we think will do the best job.
