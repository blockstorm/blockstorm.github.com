Rules for creative and skylands
===============================

Please try to build aesthetically pleasing buildings in these two worlds.

They are **not** for:

- Anything survival related (shelters, dirt houses, etc.)
- Pixel art, maps, redstone experiments, roller coasters, huge floating diamond buildings, and so on (That's what freebuild is for)

**The staff is allowed to remove all of the above**
