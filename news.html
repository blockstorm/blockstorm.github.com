This wasn't a problem until Mojang allowed players to change their usernames. Now when a player changes their name they lose all their money. Because there won't be an update to fix that I installed a different economy plugin. As a result all accounts are reset to 1000 coins.</p><p>The shop plugin was updated as well. It should be easier to search for and sell items now. For instructions on how to use it just type <code>/shop</code> in-game.</p><h1>New world for 1.8</h1><p><em>22 December 2014</em></p><p>A new world was added for <code>1.8</code>. It's called <code>survival04</code> and will replace <code>survival03</code> as the main survival world. A new nether world (<code>survival04_nether</code>) has been added as well. The previous survival world (<code>survival03</code>) will stay for a while and you can move items between the worlds by putting them in your inventory and using a portal/command.</p><p>The even older <code>survival02</code> will be deleted in February. Again, you can move your items by putting them in your inventory and teleporting to one of the newer worlds.</p><h1>1.8 Update II</h1><p><em>9 December 2014</em></p><p>You might have noticed that it took quite a bit longer to update the server to <code>1.8</code> than it usually does. The reason for the long delay was the Bukkit team quitting in early September and the lack of an alternative. Last week however the Spigot team published Spigot and Bukkit versions for <code>1.8</code> which is what the server is running now.</p><p>Since the new version hasn't been tested much it's possible that there are bugs. It's also possible that some plugins won't work correctly and need to be updated.</p><h1>1.8 Update</h1><p><em>28 August 2014</em></p><p>As you probably have heard Mojang is about to release the <code>1.8</code> update. It will include some <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/1.8#World_Generation">additions and changes</a> to the world generation code. To make it easier to find these new features we will add new world for <code>1.8</code>.</p><p>The current main survival world <code>survival03</code> as well as its nether and end worlds <code>survival03_nether</code> and <code>survival03_the_end)</code>will continue to exist.</p><p>The old survival world <code>survival02</code> stays at least until a world for <code>1.8</code> is added but will be removed next. We will let you know at least one month in advance so you can take your items to one of the newer worlds.</p><h1>Moderator rank</h1><p><em>10 February 2014</em></p><p>The Moderator rank has been renamed to Admin. The reason is that Moderators and Admins had almost the same permissions anyway. The Trusted rank is now called Moderator. All previously trusted players have been demoted. We will start accepting Moderator applications soon.</p></div></div></body></html>
